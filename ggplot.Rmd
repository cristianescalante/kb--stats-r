## Preenchimento, exemplo Histograma
REF: https://r-graphics.org/recipe-distribution-basic-hist

```{r}

# Set the width of each bin to 5 (each bin will span 5 x-axis units)
ggplot(faithful, aes(x = waiting)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "white", colour = "black")

# Divide the x range into 15 bins
binsize <- diff(range(faithful$waiting))/15

ggplot(faithful, aes(x = waiting)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = binsize, fill = "white", colour = "black")

```

## Armazenar plots em DF
You don't HAVE to store your #dataViz as individual files.
You could dynamically generate plots for some combination of variables and store each #ggplot in a #tidyverse tibble.
E.g. if you are doing #bioinformatics and you want to plot-for-each-gene

``` {r}

my_data <- palmerpenguins::penguins %>%
	drop_na %>%
	select( -year) %>%
	group_by(species, island) %>%
	nest %>%
	mutate( 
		my_plot = map(data, 
			~ggplot(
				data = .x,
				mapping = aes(x = bill_lenght_mm,
							  y = bill_depth_mm)) +
			geom_point() +
			labs( title = str_c(species, ",", island))))

my_data %>%
	pull(my_plot) %>%
	patchwork::wrap_plots()
