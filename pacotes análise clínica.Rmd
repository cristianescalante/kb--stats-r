	## clinicalsignificance
		- A clinical significance analysis can be used to determine if an intervention has a meaningful or practical effect for patients. You provide a tidy data set plus a few more metrics and this package will take care of it to make your results publication ready as proposed by Jacobson et al., (1984) <doi:10.1016/S0005-7894(84)80002-7>
